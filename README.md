# Etch-a-Sketch

This was my approach to [The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch problem] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). 

It uses a flexbox layout to display a square grid, and the number of squares can be populated based on user input. 

The squares are colored a random color with mouseover events.
